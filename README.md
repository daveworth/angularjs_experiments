# AngularJS Experiments with Shiny

# Overview

Based on the trivial examples on the Angular website I wanted to experiment with
various other technologies.  The traditional HTML+JS+CSS stack definitely works
but what about alternative template languages like Haml and Slim?  How about
CoffeeScript?  SCSS or SASS or Less? All of these compile to their respective
counterparts in HTML+JS+CSS but _should_ (in theory) reduce some degree of
overhead.
